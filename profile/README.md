## The AAMA Project

The purpose of the AAMA Project is to create a morphological archive whose data can be:

    curated (edited/created) -- and hopefully shared!
    inspected
    manipulated
    queried

on individual browsers.

In the first instance the archive should make available and comparable 
the major morphological paradigms of some forty Cushitic and Omotic languages, 
and in the longer term help situate the morphologies of these two language families within Afroasiatic. 

Ultimately we hope also that the archive and its accompanying software may serve 
as a tool for exploration of typology and structure of the form of 
linguistic organization known as the paradigm.
